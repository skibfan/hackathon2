1. Your weather app is coded really well, clean, and readable.

2. I can tell from your code that you understand all the topics learned in class, and I’m happy to see that.

3. Your project is simple but perfectly built and executed.

4. I just want to raise this point: try to improve your error handling. For example, on the login page, when I enter a wrong password, it displays "username does not exist." The same goes for the registration page — you need to handle errors better, like when not all fields are filled or the email is invalid. Proper error handling is key to writing good code.

5. I would also suggest for the future is to add more comments to your code. It helps you understand and code better, but more importantly, it helps others, like me, to read and understand your code faster.
